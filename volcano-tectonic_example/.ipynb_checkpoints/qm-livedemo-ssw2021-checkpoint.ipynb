The initial 4 hour long eruption on 29 August 2014 was followed by a major eruption which lasted 6 months, between 31 August 2014 and 27 February 2015. The Holuhraun lava flow covered 84 km2 with an estimated bulk volume of 1.4–1.6 km3, making it the largest eruption in Iceland since the 1783–1784 Laki eruption (Pedersen et al., 2017).\n",

    "        The onset function can be any function that responds in some characteristic way to the arrival (onset) of a seismic phase. It is used here to simplify the seismic waveform and retain only the important information about the seismic phase onsets. Peaks in this function related to real phase arrivals have Gaussian properties (Drew et al., 2013), which allows us to treat the function as a continuous representation of the probability for the onset of a seismic phase. We find the joint probabilistic density function as the product of all the individual onsets (done internally as the sum of the log of the onsets), which tells us how likely any given point in space/time is the source of a seismic event.<br><br>We use here the function defined as the ratio between the short-term average (STA) and the long-term average (LTA) in some windows of predefined length. The figure below shows two common relative window positions. As mentioned in the Detect and Locate sections, we typically use the 'classic' setup for Detect and the 'centred' for Locate.\n",
